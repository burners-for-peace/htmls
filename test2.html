<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>It was a day just like any other day.<span>&nbsp; </span>A high school girl named Amber was walking down the street towards the shopping mall.<span>&nbsp; </span>As she walked, she twittered her friends on her cell phone.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Suddenly, an enormous foot came down on the street right next to her.<span>&nbsp; </span>Amber looked up in shock as a 50-foot, scantily-clad, and very angry looking Darryl Hannah walked past her.<span>&nbsp; </span>A man, who Amber assumed was the woman’s cheating boyfriend judging by the look on the woman’s face, was caught in her clutches and panicking.<span>&nbsp; </span>As Darryl walked away, a squad of police cruisers chased after her.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Amber went unnoticed by the giant woman.<span>&nbsp; </span>She quickly texted her friends.<span>&nbsp; </span>“OMG!<span>&nbsp; </span>I just saw a giant”!:O</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>In the mall parking lot, there was a large group of other students who had also seen the colossal woman and were gossiping about what they saw with great excitement.<span>&nbsp; </span>Amber was about to join them when she turned her head and groaned as she saw Rachel and her posse coming towards her.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Olive was the top of pretty much everything.<span>&nbsp; </span>With her perfectly slim figure, she was a real knockout.<span>&nbsp; </span>She was the prom queen, the star athlete on her basketball team, and a straight-A student.<span>&nbsp; </span>She always had to prove that she was better than everyone else.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Today she was wearing a pair of jeans and a pink t-shirt with a heart-shaped hole revealing the top of her well-endowed melons.<span>&nbsp; </span>She and her posse were unloading shopping bags into her pink sedan.<span>&nbsp; </span>Amber walked past them and hoped she didn’t have to talk to them.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Olive turned towards her.<span>&nbsp; </span>“Yo Amber”!<span>&nbsp; </span>Sighing, Amber turned to face them.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Olive looked around.<span>&nbsp; </span>“What the hell is all this gossip about?<span>&nbsp; </span>No one has paid attention to me all day”!</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>“You missed it!<span>&nbsp; </span>There was a gigantic woman walking down the street this morning”!</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Olive raised an eyebrow.<span>&nbsp; </span>“You’re telling me this girl is getting all the attention because she’s big”?!</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>“She has to be at least 50-feet tall!<span>&nbsp; </span>I saw her up close”!</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Olive snorted.<span>&nbsp; </span>“You’re exaggerating!<span>&nbsp; </span>I’ll bet money that she’s only slightly taller than me!<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, if I wanted to, I could get just as big as her!<span>&nbsp; </span>Bigger even”!</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>It was Amber’s turn to raise an eyebrow.<span>&nbsp; </span>“I’m sorry but there is absolutely no way that you could ever approach her in size”.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Olive told her posse to stand back and turned to Amber with a smile.<span>&nbsp; </span>“Very well!<span>&nbsp; </span>I was going to throw away these jeans anyway”.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Amber was about to ask her what she meant when Olive took a deep breath, causing her stomach to expand.<span>&nbsp; </span>She took another breath, and then another.<span>&nbsp; </span>She stuck out her stomach and made it as big and bulky as she could.<span>&nbsp; </span>Her jeans started to tear as Olive began to swell in height and girth.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>At this point, the other kids started to notice that something was going on.<span>&nbsp; </span>They all gathered around to see the amazing spectacle that Olive was providing.<span>&nbsp; </span>Olive’s posse had obviously never seen this before and were standing with their jaws wide open.<span>&nbsp; </span>Amber could only stare in chilling awe.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>It didn’t take long for Olive’s jeans to split apart at the seams, exposing her legs and bottom, which were swelling just like the rest of her.<span>&nbsp; </span>Olive had to peer over her enormous belly as she puffed herself still bigger.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Soon, Olive had blown up twice her size both in height and width.<span>&nbsp; </span>She held her massively swollen belly with a look of deep satisfaction on her face.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>“So!<span>&nbsp; </span>There’s no way I can approach this woman in size, huh!<span>&nbsp; </span>Well, take a look at me now!<span>&nbsp; </span>There’s no way she was bigger than this”!</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>All the kids that had witnessed Darryl looked at Olive, then at each other.<span>&nbsp; </span>They shook their heads in agreement.<span>&nbsp; </span>“That is very impressive I must admit” replied Amber.<span>&nbsp; </span>“But that’s still nowhere near as big as the woman we saw today”.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Olive stared with amazement and disappointment.<span>&nbsp; </span>But she wasn’t about to let this go yet.<span>&nbsp; </span>“You know I really liked this shirt.<span>&nbsp; </span>Oh well”!</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>She raised her head and started to inhale some more.<span>&nbsp; </span>She took breath after breath, and her entire body swelled even further.<span>&nbsp; </span>Her arms and legs were becoming as thick as an elephant’s.<span>&nbsp; </span>Her bottom ballooned out until her panties could barely contain them.<span>&nbsp; </span>Her breasts also ballooned outward until they were as big as beach balls.<span>&nbsp; </span>With great effort, Olive made herself both taller and wider.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>All the other kids were cheering her on, chanting for her to get bigger.<span>&nbsp; </span>One kid was filming the event on his iphone camera so he could post it on youtube.<span>&nbsp; </span>As Rachel swelled up, so did her pride, and a smug expression spread across her face.<span>&nbsp; </span>The only kid who seemed worried was Amber.<span>&nbsp; </span>She knew that this wasn’t going to end well.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>With a might rip, Olive’s shirt burst into tiny pieces.<span>&nbsp; </span>She resembled an enormous sumo wrestler with every part of her body massively swollen.<span>&nbsp; </span>Her panties had long since blown apart.<span>&nbsp; </span>The only thing she was wearing was a bra that was being stretched to its limit.<span>&nbsp; </span>She spanned the length of her sedan.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>The other kids hooted and hollered at the spectacle.<span>&nbsp; </span>Olive made a deep laugh.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>“Ha!<span>&nbsp; </span>How do you like me now Amber?!<span>&nbsp; </span>Is this big enough for you”!</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>The kids looked at each other once again and shook their heads.<span>&nbsp; </span>“Look!” said Amber.<span>&nbsp; </span>“What you just did is impressive enough.<span>&nbsp; </span>You don’t have to compare yourself to others.<span>&nbsp; </span>You’re great already”.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>“In other words, she’s still bigger than me”!!<span>&nbsp; </span>Olive was pissed.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Amber sadly shook her head.<span>&nbsp; </span>She had hoped that Olive would admit defeat.<span>&nbsp; </span>Her hopes were quickly shattered.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>“All right, then!<span>&nbsp; </span>You want to see colossal!<span>&nbsp; </span>Feast your eyes on this”!</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>She took an enormous breath and ballooned herself so much that her bra snapped into oblivion.<span>&nbsp; </span>Olive was blowing herself up with more dedication than ever.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Everyone started backing away at this point, with many kids heading for the hills.<span>&nbsp; </span>Even the guy filming the event eventually lost his nerve and fled.<span>&nbsp; </span>Olive’s posse ran off without her.<span>&nbsp; </span>Amber quickly walked backwards away from her, still unable to take her eyes off Olive’s massive form.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Olive puffed and expanded into an enormous round ball with a monstrously swollen belly, butt and breasts.<span>&nbsp; </span>Her skin was stretched to almost the breaking point.<span>&nbsp; </span>Her arms and legs stuck out uselessly from her bloated form.<span>&nbsp; </span>Her head looked like it was about to be swallowed completely.<span>&nbsp; </span>Her face was red, and her brow was sweaty.<span>&nbsp; </span>Still, Olive didn’t stop.<span>&nbsp; </span>She was so intent on outdoing this other woman in size that she was willing to blow herself up to her absolute limit.<span>&nbsp; </span>She chuckled to herself.<span>&nbsp; </span>She was clearly experience a thrill from all this exertion.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Olive was now the width of a school bus and stood nearly as high as the shopping mall behind her.<span>&nbsp; </span>Amber was the only kid left.<span>&nbsp; </span>Knowing she was in danger, she ducked underneath a parked mini-van.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Olive shouted out loud.<span>&nbsp; </span>“NOW…SHE CAN’T BE…THIS BIG”!</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>KABOOM!!</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>The blast sent many cars flying.<span>&nbsp; </span>Amber waited until the mini-van she was hiding under stopped shaking before poking her head out.<span>&nbsp; </span>There was a massive crater near where Olive’s sedan was once parked.<span>&nbsp; </span>The explosion was so quick and sudden that nothing remained of poor Olive.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>No one was going to get in trouble for Olive’s death.<span>&nbsp; </span>The entire event had been filmed.</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>As Amber strolled back home, she thought about how her mom had always said that self-conceit could lead to self-destruction.<span>&nbsp; </span>Mom was right.</span></span></p>
